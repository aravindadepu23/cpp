/* 
Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, false otherwise.
A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward as backward. 
That means; after reversing it, it is still the same string. 
For example: "abcdcba", or "racecar".
Note: Use two pointer approach.

Sample test case 
case=1
input=abcdcba
output=true

case=2
input=raceacar
output=false
